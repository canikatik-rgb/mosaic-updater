# Mosaic
## The Virtual Office Canvas OS

**Turn your office into a limitless digital playground.**

Mosaic is not just another collaboration tool; it's a **"Virtual Office OS"** designed for the modern, distributed workforce. It reimagines the workspace as an **infinite, living node canvas** where teams live, talk, share, and build together in real-time. Neither a simple whiteboard nor a rigid project management tool—Mosaic is a fluid digital environment that adapts to how you think.

## 🚀 The Vision

We believe the future of work isn't about sending files back and forth or getting lost in endless notification streams. It's about **presence**. 

Mosaic brings back the "shoulder-to-shoulder" feeling of a physical office, but with the superpowers of software.

> **"Don't just share a file. Share your workspace."**

## 💎 Core Pillars

### 1. The Semantic Data Protocol (SDP)
At the heart of Mosaic lies a powerful, proprietary data structure. Every piece of content—be it text, an image, a PDF, or a 3D model—is treated as a **Semantic Node**. This allows for effortless interoperability, smart data binding, and intelligent context awareness across your entire workspace.

### 2. Local-First & P2P Architecture
Your data belongs to you. Mosaic is built on a **Local-First** philosophy. 
- **Zero-Latency:** Work primarily on your device with native performance.
- **Serverless Collaboration:** Our advanced **P2P engine** allows you to host projects directly from your machine. Connect with teammates via secure, encrypted tunnels without your data ever resting on a central server.
- **Offline Capable:** The internet is optional. Keep working; sync happens magically when you reconnect.

### 3. The Infinite Browser Node
Why tab-switch when you can embed the web? Mosaic introduces **URL Nodes**—fully functional, interactive browser instances living directly on your canvas. 
- **Spatial Browsing:** Organize web apps, research papers, and live dashboards side-by-side.
- **Smart Extraction:** Drag content from a live website directly into your workspace as a native node.

### 4. Bi-Directional Harmony
Mosaic doesn't just display information; it interacts with it. Our architecture is designed to bridge the gap between your canvas and external applications, enabling flows where data moves seamlessly in both directions.
